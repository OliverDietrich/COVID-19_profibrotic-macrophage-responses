# SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers profibrotic macrophage responses and lung fibrosis

Please have a look at our [publication](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01383-0#secsectitle0015)

This repository contains the code used to analyze the phenotype of macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid  ([here](https://github.com/OliverDietrich/SARS-CoV-2-infection-triggers-profibrotic-macrophage-responses-and-lung-fibrosis/blob/main/R/BAL-macrophages.R)) as well as primary monocytes stimulated among others with SARS-CoV-2 ([here](https://github.com/OliverDietrich/SARS-CoV-2-infection-triggers-profibrotic-macrophage-responses-and-lung-fibrosis/blob/main/R/Monocytes.R)). It will guide users from retrieval of data from a cloud service to final visualizations.
